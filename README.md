# Pizza Project

Pizza Project is a pizza üçï order and delivery system made for fun.

##### It consists of two parts:
- Ordering App: The app through which a customer can select and order pizzas.
- Delivery App: The app for the staff to view ordered pizzas.

To store and manage ordered pizzas orders are processed through a backend.
